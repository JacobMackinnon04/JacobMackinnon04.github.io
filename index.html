            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Jacob. I'm enrolling in RIT for a Masters' in Software Engineering. I previously attended Old Colony Regional Vocational Technical High School in Massachusetts, and I graduated as part of the Honor Society with consistent honor roll. In my spare time, I like to use my programming knowledge to make video games (though they don't get very far), and I also like to play them too for inspiration.
            </p>

            <p>My favorite season is winter, as I do not like hot weather at all. Every year, my family goes on a vacation to New Hampshire, as we all love the cozy feeling of a cabin! My favorite color depends on the mood, but typically I like blue or purple. I have three cats, one of which is my grandmothers'. I also have an older brother who plays football at UMass Amherst.</p>

            <h2>My Favorite Food:</h2>
            <p>Here is a picture of my favorite food: pizza! I've come to really like Salvatore's Pizza.</p>
